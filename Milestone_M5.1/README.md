##### **Milestone M5.1.**: Algorithm for calculation of abundance and occurrence of birds from citizen science and earth observation data (M15). Code publicly available on Git

1. We downloaded all occurrence data available on GBIF for all avian species over for 10 years for our 4 study sites. Script:  `DownloadAllSpsPerStudySite.r `
2. For each species at each study site we modeled a habitat suitability. Script: `habitat_suitability_modeling_all_studysites.r`
3. Estimating relative abundance for each species based on the habitat suitability predictions. To be done.
